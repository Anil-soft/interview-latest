🧠 How it All Works – Step by Step
🔧 You configure Jenkins with the repo, inventory file, and playbook.
🧑‍🏫 Jenkins pipeline starts and asks which region you want to deploy to (using the REGION parameter).
📥 Jenkins checks out your code from GitHub.
⚙️ Jenkins makes sure Ansible is installed.
🛰️ Jenkins calls the Ansible playbook and passes the selected region (target_group) to it.
🔑 Ansible uses SSH to connect to the IPs in the chosen group.
📦 It installs Java, copies the JAR, and starts the app on each EC2 instance in that region.

✅ Interview-Ready Summary
"We use a parameterized Jenkins pipeline that triggers an Ansible playbook based on the selected region. The Ansible inventory is organized by region, 
and it uses SSH to deploy the JAR to the appropriate EC2s. This approach scales easily to multiple regions and environments, supports consistent deployments, 
and separates infrastructure logic from CI/CD logic."

2. if your Jenkins build failed with the resource constrains how can you debug that issue and how can you diagnose that?
✅ 2. Step 2: Check Jenkins Agent/Node Health
Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Nodes.
Select the node where the build ran and check:
Free disk space
Connected status
Executor usage
Load statistics
You can also SSH into the node and use:
top             # Check CPU & Memory usage
free -m         # RAM usage
df -h           # Disk usage
uptime          # Load average
vmstat 1 5      # Memory/CPU stats over 5 seconds

✅ 3. Step 3: Free Up Resources
Here are standard commands to clear up space:
# Remove Docker images and containers
docker system prune -af
# Clear workspace directories
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/*
# Clear Jenkins build history (if older builds not needed)
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/*/builds
# Clear logs
rm -rf /var/log/jenkins/*
# Temp files
rm -rf /tmp/*
Also make sure your Jenkins master has enough space if it's storing artifacts.

✅ 4. Step 4: Auto-Cleanup Strategy (Optional But Ideal)
Add post-build clean-up in your Jenkinsfile:
post {
    always {
        cleanWs()  // This cleans up the workspace after every build
    }
}

✅ 6. Step 6: Retry Build or Use Jenkins Retry Logic
Use a retry block in your pipeline:
retry(3) {
    sh 'mvn clean install'
}
If build fails because of temporary load, retrying helps.

✅ 7. Step 7: Prevention - Monitoring and Auto-Scaling
Set up:
CloudWatch Alarms (for EC2 agent disk, CPU)
Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
Slack/Email notifications for high usage
Auto-scaling group for Jenkins workers
Example in CloudWatch:
Alarm for disk < 10%
Alarm for memory > 90%
Alarm for swap usage

🎯 BONUS: What If Jenkins Is Hosted on Kubernetes?
Each agent pod should have CPU/Memory requests and limits.
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to add more pods during peak builds.
Use nodeSelector or taints to control where builds land.
Jenkins master should not be used for builds — only control plane.

✅ Final Interview-Ready Answer (Pro Level)
“When a Jenkins build fails due to resource constraints, I immediately check the build logs to identify if it's a CPU, memory, or disk issue. 
I inspect the Jenkins node metrics, either via the UI or by SSHing in and using Linux tools like top, df -h, and free -m. 
I clean up Docker artifacts, old build logs, and workspace data. If it's a frequent issue, I optimize our agents with proper memory/CPU requests, 
integrate alerts via CloudWatch or Prometheus, and scale Jenkins agents dynamically using auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes pods. 
I also use cleanWs() and retry blocks in pipelines to make them more resilient.”

3. If you application load balancer getting an error like 502 code how would you monitor and troubleshoot the issue?
✅ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide
1. 🔍 Check ALB Target Health
Go to EC2 > Load Balancers > Your ALB > Target Groups
Check target health status:
Is it healthy or unhealthy?
over the status to see why it's unhealthy.
🔧 Common issues:
Wrong port configured (e.g., your app runs on 8080 but ALB checks 80)
App not responding to health checks
App crashed or not started properly

2. 📜 Check ALB Access Logs
Enable access logs on the ALB
Look for 502 error codes
You’ll see which IP and path caused the issue

3. 🧪 Check Application Logs on Target EC2 / ECS / Lambda
SSH into the EC2 or check logs from CloudWatch or ECS logs:
Is the app running?
Does the app crash or throw errors?
Is the server (like Nginx/Tomcat) responding?

4. 🔧 Check Security Group and Network ACLs
Make sure:
ALB security group allows traffic to target EC2's port
EC2 security group allows traffic from ALB
No NACL is blocking the request

5. 🧠 Verify Listener & Target Group Configuration
ALB listener (say, HTTP:80 or HTTPS:443) forwards to correct Target Group
Target Group protocol and port match the app’s actual port

6. 🌐 Test the Application Manually
SSH into the EC2 and run:
curl http://localhost:8080

Or from another EC2 in same VPC:
curl http://<Target EC2 Private IP>:8080
✅ If this fails, your app is not running or has a config issue

7. 🔒 Check TLS/SSL (if HTTPS used)
If you're using HTTPS, make sure:
SSL cert is valid
App supports HTTPS if you terminate TLS at the instance level

🛠️ Final Checklist for Interview Answer:
“First, I check ALB target group health to confirm if targets are healthy. If they’re not, I SSH into the instance and check application logs and whether the app is responding 
on the correct port. I also verify that security groups, listener rules, and target ports are correctly set. 
If needed, I enable ALB access logs and CloudWatch metrics for deeper visibility. For HTTPS issues, I ensure SSL certs and protocols are configured properly.”

4. what is the difference between terraform and cloudformation why do we need to go with the terraform?
   “While CloudFormation is a native AWS service, we prefer Terraform because of its modular design, support for multiple cloud providers, 
   and the powerful plan feature that clearly shows the impact of changes. It also offers better reusability, faster iteration, and a larger community-driven ecosystem.”
   Tons of open-source modules, GitHub templates, and plugins — faster development & onboarding.

   “CloudFormation is great for AWS-native teams, but it has several limitations like verbosity, lack of multi-cloud support, limited modularity, 
    and slower adoption of new AWS features. Terraform gives us more flexibility, better code structure, and faster iteration with plan, apply, and reusable modules.”

5.what is stopping the instance and hibernating the instance?
  ✅ 1. Stopping an EC2 Instance
When you stop an EC2 instance:
The OS is shut down gracefully.
The instance store data is lost (if using ephemeral storage).
The EBS root volume is preserved.
The RAM content is cleared (i.e., memory state is not preserved).
No instance-hour charges apply while stopped (but EBS charges remain).
The public IP changes if it’s not an Elastic IP.
Instance can be restarted later — boots from scratch.

Interview explanation:
“When we stop an instance, the memory state is lost, and it boots as a fresh machine next time. It's ideal for temporarily deallocating resources without deleting them.”

✅ 2. Hibernating an EC2 Instance
When you hibernate an instance:
The OS is paused, not shut down.
The contents of RAM are saved to the EBS volume.
On restart, it resumes from the exact state it was paused in — apps, sessions, cache, etc. remain intact.
The EBS cost increases because it stores RAM snapshot.
Hibernation must be enabled when you launch the instance.
Only supported on:
Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows
Certain instance types (like t2, t3, m5)
Instances with less than 150 GB of RAM

Interview explanation:
“Hibernation is useful when we want to pause workloads and resume them quickly without restarting apps or reinitializing memory-heavy processes — for example,
long-running simulations or in-memory caches.”

6. Suppose I created an EC2 instance with the public IP so If i attach an EIP what will happen to the public IP?
   🔥 So, what happens to the original public IP?
👉 The auto-assigned public IP gets released immediately.
👉 Your instance now uses the Elastic IP (EIP) as its public IP address.

🧠 Why?
Because:
Auto-assigned public IPs are dynamic – they change on stop/start.
Elastic IPs are static – they stay with your account until you release them.
You can’t have two public IPs on the same network interface (by default).
Attaching an EIP replaces the auto-assigned public IP.

✅ Example for Interview:
“When an EC2 instance is launched with an auto-assigned public IP and later an Elastic IP is attached, 
 the original public IP is released immediately. The instance now communicates via the Elastic IP. 
 This is useful when we need a persistent public IP that doesn’t change across reboots or stops.”

7. "If everything seems correctly configured for your S3 bucket, but you're still unable to access it, 
    what could be the possible reasons and how would you troubleshoot?

1. Check Block Public Access Settings
Even if your bucket policy or object ACL allows public access, these settings override them.
Go to S3 → Bucket → Permissions → Block Public Access
Ensure block all public access is unchecked if you intend to allow public access.

2. Validate the Bucket Policy
Ensure the bucket policy is not too restrictive.
🔍 Example: To allow public read:
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  }]
}

3. IAM Role or User Policy Permissions
If you're using AWS CLI or SDK, make sure the IAM role/user has the right permissions.
✅ Minimum required for access:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}

4. S3 VPC Endpoint Restrictions
If your S3 access is through a VPC endpoint, check:
The endpoint policy might be denying access.
Bucket policy might allow access only from specific VPCs/VPC endpoint IDs.
📌 Bucket policy example restricting to VPC endpoint:
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-1234567890abcdef0"
  }
}

8. what is the difference between declarative and imperative pipeline??
   imperative uses groovy script and it started with node
   Declarative pipeline also built in groovy but it uses DSL
   Declarative starts with pipeline and groovy starts with node
   Declarative will be having Restart from stage and groovy doesn't have.

9. what is connection draining in load balancers and how to do that?
   Imagine you're deploying a new version of your application. If you terminate an instance immediately, 
   active users connected to that instance will lose their session or get errors.
   With Connection Draining:
   The instance stops receiving new requests.
   It continues to serve existing users until they complete or until a timeout is reached.
   Wait up to 300 seconds (5 minutes) for those users to finish.
   After that time, forcefully closes any remaining connections.

   🔧 How to Enable Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay) in AWS:
   ✅ For Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB):
   You configure this on the Target Group.

   🛠 Steps in Console:
   Go to EC2 Console > Target Groups.
   Select your target group.
   Click "Attributes" tab.
   Edit Deregistration Delay (Default: 300 seconds, i.e. 5 minutes).

   💡 Why this matters:
   Let’s say your app has:
   Long-running connections (e.g., file uploads, payments, video streaming)
   You terminate the instance without draining: users will get 502/504 errors.
   With Connection Draining, AWS waits to avoid cutting off active users.

   10. what are the plugins you installed in Kubernetes??
   Monitoring tools are deployed as pods in Kubernetes because everything in Kubernetes runs in containers. 
   Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are containerized and managed just like app workloads. 
   We install them as add-ons because Kubernetes by default is minimal—it provides orchestration but doesn’t include logging, 
   monitoring, or ingress capabilities, so we install the needed plugins depending on the use case

   ✅ 1. Install Calico (CNI Plugin)
Calico is used for network policies and pod networking.

📦 Apply Calico manifest (for kubeadm-based clusters):
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/calico.yaml

✅ 2. Install Prometheus & Grafana (Monitoring Tools)
You can install them using Helm (recommended way).

🛠 Step 1: Add the Helm repo
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

🧭 Step 2: Install Prometheus
 helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

 📊 Step 3: Install Grafana
  helm install grafana grafana/grafana --set adminPassword='admin123'

  You can access Grafana via:
   kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana"

  ✅ 3. Install NGINX Ingress Controller
  This is used to expose your apps to the outside world via HTTP/HTTPS.

📦 Apply NGINX ingress controller:
 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.9.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

10. How can you import the modules in Lambda function which are not available in AWS like pandas, numpy, matplotlib?
✅ Step-by-Step to Use Custom Libraries in Lambda
📦 Step 1: Set Up Your Working Directory
Create a project folder:
mkdir my_lambda_function
cd my_lambda_function

Create your Lambda function file (e.g., lambda_function.py):
import pandas as pd

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    data = {"Name": ["Anil", "John"], "Age": [28, 30]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df.to_json()

📥 Step 2: Install Dependencies Locally
Install the required libraries into a subfolder called python:

✅ Note: Use Amazon Linux 2 or a Docker image to ensure compatibility with the Lambda environment.
pip install pandas -t python/

🗜️ Step 3: Zip the Package
Move into the python directory and zip everything:
cd python
zip -r ../lambda_package.zip .

Add your Lambda function code to the zip:
cd ..
zip -g lambda_package.zip lambda_function.py

☁️ Step 4: Upload to AWS Lambda
You have two options:

Option A: Upload using AWS Console
Go to AWS Lambda → Your function → Upload zip file

11. how can you store the secrets in Kubernetes, suppose if you push secrets.yaml the secrets can be visible 
in repo and how can you encrypt them??

✅ Secure Solution 1: Bitnami Sealed Secrets
🔒 What is Sealed Secrets?
It’s a controller + CLI tool that encrypts secrets so you can safely store them in Git.
You create a secret as usual.
You encrypt it using the cluster's public key.
Only the cluster (with the private key) can decrypt it.
🔧 Setup Steps:
🔹 Step 1: Install Sealed Secrets in Your Cluster

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.24.1/controller.yaml

This installs the controller that will decrypt the secrets at runtime.

🔹 Step 2: Install the kubeseal CLI
On your local machine:
brew install kubeseal           # For Mac
sudo apt install kubeseal       # For Ubuntu/Debian

🔹 Step 3: Create a normal secret file (not apply yet)
   kubectl create secret generic my-secret \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password=123456 \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml > my-secret.yaml

This is a local file, not pushed to the cluster.
🔹 Step 4: Encrypt it using kubeseal
kubeseal --controller-name=sealed-secrets \
         --controller-namespace=kube-system \
         < my-secret.yaml \
         --format yaml > my-sealed-secret.yaml
This creates my-sealed-secret.yaml — it looks like this:
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  encryptedData:
    username: AgB3H9k...
    password: Ax98sK...

You can now safely push this to GitHub — it's fully encrypted.
kubectl apply -f my-sealed-secret.yaml
The controller will decrypt it inside the cluster and create a normal secret.

12. I have 3 azs and 3 nodes on each az suppose if I want to deploy a pod and each node in each az how can you do that??
 Step 1: Understand How Kubernetes Knows AZs
Cloud providers like AWS automatically label each node with the zone it's in:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep topology.kubernetes.io/zone
You’ll see:
ip-10-0-0-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1a
ip-10-0-1-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1b
ip-10-0-2-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1c

✅ Good News: You don't need to label manually in EKS — it’s automatic!

🥈 Step 2: Apply Deployment YAML with topologySpreadConstraints
Here’s the YAML to create a Deployment with 3 replicas, one in each AZ:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: 1
          topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
          whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: web-app
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
topologySpreadConstraints:- Spread rules for pod placement
maxSkew: 1:- No zone can have more than 1 extra pod compared to others
topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone: Spread based on AZs
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule: Don’t place pods if they violate spread

"To ensure high availability and zone-level redundancy, I used Kubernetes topologySpreadConstraints in my Deployment. 
This ensures the pods are evenly distributed across availability zones based on the node’s topology.kubernetes.io/zone label. 
I used maxSkew: 1 to enforce balance and DoNotSchedule to avoid overloading a zone. 
This gives automatic, clean, and production-grade zone balancing."

12. what are the difference between spot, on demand and dedicated instances??
✅ 1. On-Demand Instances
🔹 What it is:
You launch an EC2 instance when you need it and pay per hour or per second. There is no long-term commitment.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
You are building a web application for a client and you're testing different versions of it. 
You don’t know how long you'll need the server, maybe only a few days or weeks.
After 3 days, you complete the testing and terminate the instance. You only pay for those 3 days.

✅ 2. Reserved Instances (RIs)
🔹 What it is:
You commit to using an instance type in a specific region for 1 or 3 years in exchange for up to 75% discount 
compared to On-Demand.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
Your company has a production database server (t3.large) that must run 24/7 for 3 years.
You know it will be used continuously. So, you buy a Reserved Instance for t3.large in us-east-1.
This way, you save around 60-75% on the cost.

✅ 4. Dedicated Instances
🔹 What it is:
You get EC2 instances running on physical hardware that is fully dedicated to your AWS account.
Unlike normal EC2s which share hardware with other customers (multi-tenancy), this is single-tenant.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
You are working on a banking app that requires strict compliance and hardware isolation 
(for example, you must not share a physical server with another customer).

✅ What is a Spot Instance?
A Spot Instance is an EC2 virtual machine that uses unused EC2 capacity in AWS.
It’s very cheap — up to 90% less cost than On-Demand instances.
BUT… AWS can take it away anytime with a 2-minute warning ⚠️ if it needs that capacity back.

✅ Real-Life Example:
Let’s say your company is training a Machine Learning model that takes 4 hours.
This is a non-urgent task, and if it stops and resumes again later — it’s still fine.
So instead of using a normal On-Demand EC2 and spending ₹500, you launch a Spot Instance for the same type — and spend only ₹50
But remember:
If AWS needs that EC2 capacity, your instance is terminated suddenly.
So you must build your script to save progress every 15 minutes (like saving a game).

what is placement groups in AWS?
✅ Cluster
🔹Packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve 
  the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of
  high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
  You can launch multiple instance types into a cluster placement group.

✅ Partition 
🔹Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share 
  the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large 
  distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.
  A partition placement group supports a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone.
  The number of instances that you can launch in a partition placement group is limited only by your account limits.

✅ Spread 
🔹Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.
  A rack spread placement group supports a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone.
  For example, in a Region with three Availability Zones, you can run a total of 21 instances in the group, 
  with seven instances in each Availability Zone.

if I want to do some patching on RDS instance how can I do that??
✅ 1. Use Multi-AZ RDS Deployment
When you enable Multi-AZ:

AWS maintains a synchronous standby replica in another AZ.
During patching, AWS:
Patches the standby instance first.
Promotes it to primary.
Then patches the old primary.

🧠 Impact:
Small failover event (20–60 seconds), connections are automatically redirected.
No data loss or manual intervention required.

🔁 Maintenance Windows (If Above Aren’t Used)
If you're not using advanced setups:
Schedule patching during non-peak hours via Maintenance Window.
RDS will:
Take a snapshot
Apply patch
Reboot the instance (minor latency)

how can I build the RDS instance with the disaster recovery??

1️⃣ Enable Multi-AZ Deployment (High Availability)
📌 Why?
AWS automatically provisions a standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ).
In case the primary instance fails, it automatically fails over to standby.

2️⃣ Enable Automated Backups and Point-in-Time Recovery
📌 Why?
Allows you to restore your DB to any second within your backup window.
📌 Setup:
Configure retention period (up to 35 days).
Turn on automated backups.

3️⃣ Enable Cross-Region Read Replicas (for Regional Disaster Recovery)
📌 Why?
If your entire region goes down, a cross-region read replica can be promoted to become a standalone primary.
You can redirect traffic to the new region.

what are the difference between logs and metrics and traces??
📘 1. Logs – What Happened?
Think of logs like a diary of what your app/system is doing.
They are text entries generated by apps, services, OS, or middleware.
🔧 Example:
2025-04-14 12:01:32 ERROR: Database connection timeout for user_id=453

📊 2. Metrics – How Is It Performing?
Metrics are numerical values collected over time.
They are used in dashboards, alerts, autoscaling.
🔧 Example:
CPU Utilization: 85%
Request Latency: 140 ms
Disk IOPS: 400

🌐 3. Traces – What Path Did a Request Take?
Traces track the journey of a single request as it moves through different services in a distributed system.
Helps find bottlenecks in microservices.

🔧 Example:
A trace for API call /purchase:
→ frontend (50ms)
   → auth-service (30ms)
      → payment-service (120ms)
         → DB (10ms)

So, a trace helps you visualize:
Total request duration
Which service took the longest
Where failure or latency occurred

If there are multiple instructions are defined in Dockerfile which one is going to take execute??

FROM centos:centos7
CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install","httpd"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]

✅ 1. CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
This sets the default command to run only if no command is provided during container run
But CMD can be overridden by ENTRYPOINT
And here, it's never used — because ENTRYPOINT will run instead

⚠️ 2. ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install","httpd"]
This would have become the actual command executed when the container runs
But…

❌ 3. ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]
This overwrites the previous ENTRYPOINT
Docker only uses the last ENTRYPOINT defined — earlier ones are ignored
So this becomes the final and effective command that runs when the container starts

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello World"]

It will execute:
echo Hello World
✅ Because CMD acts as default arguments to ENTRYPOINT

CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]

ENTRYPOINT is already providing its own full command with arguments: echo Hello World
So CMD is ignored entirely

FROM centos:centos7
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Anil is a DevOps pro"]

Output:
Anil is a DevOps pro

FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "First ENTRY"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Second ENTRY"]

🟢 Runs: echo Second ENTRY
🛑 First ENTRYPOINT is ignored

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint1.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]

❓ What Will Actually Execute?
/entrypoint.sh /entrypoint2.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint1.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint3.sh"]

✅ Final Effective Dockerfile (after resolution):
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint3.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]

🧠 Tip for Mastery:
Think of Docker like a "last-write-wins" config:
ENTRYPOINT → Main executable
CMD → Default argument(s) for ENTRYPOINT (only if no args passed during docker run)

See I have few aws accounts if any user tries to spin up an instances with specific instance type that should be denied
how can you do that?

✅ Solution: Use AWS IAM Policies to Deny Specific EC2 Instance Types
You can create an IAM policy that denies the RunInstances action if the instance type matches one or more specific types 
(e.g., t3.2xlarge, g4dn.xlarge, etc.)

🛡️ Example IAM Policy to Deny Specific Instance Types
 {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenySpecificEC2InstanceTypes",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": [
            "t3.2xlarge",
            "g4dn.xlarge",
            "r5.4xlarge"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

If the user tries to launch one of the restricted instance types, the request is denied.

💡 Pro Tip: Combine with Allow Policy
Make sure you don’t override with an explicit Allow policy elsewhere.
AWS always respects Deny first if both Allow and Deny are present.

Use AWS SCP (Service Control Policy) for Org-wide Enforcement
If you're using AWS Organizations, apply a Service Control Policy (SCP) at the OU (Organizational Unit) or account level to enforce 
restrictions across accounts.

🧠 Bonus: Condition by Tag or Region
You can even restrict by:
Region (aws:RequestedRegion)
AMI ID (ec2:ImageId)
Tags (to allow specific business units)

🔐 Use AWS Organizations + Service Control Policies (SCPs)
✅ What are SCPs?
Service Control Policies are like "guardrails" for all IAM entities (users/roles) in an account.
SCPs don't grant permissions — they set the maximum permissions.
Applied at the Organization Root, OU, or account level.

🛠️ Steps to Apply Least Privilege Policy Across All Accounts
🔹 Step 1: Enable AWS Organizations (if not already)
Sign in to your management/root account
Go to AWS Organizations
Create or manage an OU (Organizational Unit) with your AWS accounts

accounts

🔹 Step 2: Create an SCP with Least Privilege Rules
Example: Deny everything except S3 read-only and EC2 Describe actions
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowEC2Describe",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyAllOthers",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

📌 This effectively creates a least privilege boundary for every IAM user or role — 
    they cannot do anything outside of S3 read-only and EC2 describe.

🔹 Step 3: Attach SCP to Root or OU
Go to AWS Organizations > Policies > Service Control Policies
Create and attach the policy to:
The Root → affects all accounts
A specific OU → affects only grouped accounts

how the DNS resolution happen in AWS, suppose I have 100 instances and there is no load balancer so how the DNS resolution happen??

is AWS lambda can connect with VPC if yes then why??
But — like any compute — your Lambda still needs network access if it wants to:

Talk to a database
Hit an API
Reach an S3 bucket
Or call an external service
So let’s explore what kind of network Lambda runs in.

🌐 Where Does Lambda Run By Default?
By default, Lambda runs in an AWS-managed VPC.
This means:
You don’t see or control the network
Lambda is outside your own custom VPC
Lambda has internet access by default (via NATs AWS manages)
But it cannot access private resources inside your VPC

📌 What does "AWS-managed VPC" mean?
AWS creates and manages an internal, invisible VPC for running Lambda.
This is great for public internet calls — like hitting:
https://api.openai.com
https://yourapp.com/send-email

✅ But you cannot use it to:
Connect to a private RDS DB
SSH into a private EC2
Access internal-only APIs in your VPC
Because Lambda is outside your VPC, it has no route to those private subnets.

✅ Why Would You Connect Lambda to Your VPC?
If your Lambda function needs to access:
🗄️ RDS DB	You deployed it in private subnet, no public IP
🧠 ElastiCache / Redis	 Only accessible within the VPC
💼 EC2 backend	 EC2s are private, need Lambda to talk to them
🧪 Internal microservices (no internet endpoint)	Hosted in private subnets
🛡️ Private APIs or Internal NLBs Require internal DNS/IP access

🏗️ What Happens When You Attach Lambda to a VPC?
Lambda attaches ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) to the subnets you specify
These ENIs are how Lambda connects to your private network
Your Lambda runs inside the private subnet, just like EC2 would

🔒 But here’s the catch:
Now Lambda loses internet access!
Why? Because private subnets don’t have internet
So, if your Lambda also needs to call https://api.example.com, you must add:
A NAT Gateway
Or route to a public subnet
