pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING = "False"
    }

    parameters {
        choice(name: 'REGION', choices: ['us_east_1', 'ap_south_1'], description: 'Select AWS region to deploy')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/multi-region-deploy.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'which ansible || sudo yum install -y ansible'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy Application') {
            steps {
                dir('ansible') {
                    sh "ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy.yml --extra-vars \"target_group=${params.REGION}\""
                }
            }
        }
    }

🧠 How it All Works – Step by Step
🔧 You configure Jenkins with the repo, inventory file, and playbook.
🧑‍🏫 Jenkins pipeline starts and asks which region you want to deploy to (using the REGION parameter).
📥 Jenkins checks out your code from GitHub.
⚙️ Jenkins makes sure Ansible is installed.
🛰️ Jenkins calls the Ansible playbook and passes the selected region (target_group) to it.
🔑 Ansible uses SSH to connect to the IPs in the chosen group.
📦 It installs Java, copies the JAR, and starts the app on each EC2 instance in that region.

✅ Interview-Ready Summary
"We use a parameterized Jenkins pipeline that triggers an Ansible playbook based on the selected region. The Ansible inventory is organized by region, 
and it uses SSH to deploy the JAR to the appropriate EC2s. This approach scales easily to multiple regions and environments, supports consistent deployments, 
and separates infrastructure logic from CI/CD logic."

if your Jenkins build failed with the resource constrains how can you debug that issue and how can you diagnose that?
✅ 2. Step 2: Check Jenkins Agent/Node Health
Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Nodes.
Select the node where the build ran and check:
Free disk space
Connected status
Executor usage
Load statistics
You can also SSH into the node and use:
top             # Check CPU & Memory usage
free -m         # RAM usage
df -h           # Disk usage
uptime          # Load average
vmstat 1 5      # Memory/CPU stats over 5 seconds

✅ 3. Step 3: Free Up Resources
Here are standard commands to clear up space:
# Remove Docker images and containers
docker system prune -af
# Clear workspace directories
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/*
# Clear Jenkins build history (if older builds not needed)
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/*/builds
# Clear logs
rm -rf /var/log/jenkins/*
# Temp files
rm -rf /tmp/*
Also make sure your Jenkins master has enough space if it's storing artifacts.

✅ 4. Step 4: Auto-Cleanup Strategy (Optional But Ideal)
Add post-build clean-up in your Jenkinsfile:
post {
    always {
        cleanWs()  // This cleans up the workspace after every build
    }
}

✅ 6. Step 6: Retry Build or Use Jenkins Retry Logic
Use a retry block in your pipeline:
retry(3) {
    sh 'mvn clean install'
}
If build fails because of temporary load, retrying helps.

✅ 7. Step 7: Prevention - Monitoring and Auto-Scaling
Set up:
CloudWatch Alarms (for EC2 agent disk, CPU)
Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
Slack/Email notifications for high usage
Auto-scaling group for Jenkins workers
Example in CloudWatch:
Alarm for disk < 10%
Alarm for memory > 90%
Alarm for swap usage

🎯 BONUS: What If Jenkins Is Hosted on Kubernetes?
Each agent pod should have CPU/Memory requests and limits.
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to add more pods during peak builds.
Use nodeSelector or taints to control where builds land.
Jenkins master should not be used for builds — only control plane.

✅ Final Interview-Ready Answer (Pro Level)
“When a Jenkins build fails due to resource constraints, I immediately check the build logs to identify if it's a CPU, memory, or disk issue. 
I inspect the Jenkins node metrics, either via the UI or by SSHing in and using Linux tools like top, df -h, and free -m. 
I clean up Docker artifacts, old build logs, and workspace data. If it's a frequent issue, I optimize our agents with proper memory/CPU requests, 
integrate alerts via CloudWatch or Prometheus, and scale Jenkins agents dynamically using auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes pods. 
I also use cleanWs() and retry blocks in pipelines to make them more resilient.”
