🧠 How it All Works – Step by Step
🔧 You configure Jenkins with the repo, inventory file, and playbook.
🧑‍🏫 Jenkins pipeline starts and asks which region you want to deploy to (using the REGION parameter).
📥 Jenkins checks out your code from GitHub.
⚙️ Jenkins makes sure Ansible is installed.
🛰️ Jenkins calls the Ansible playbook and passes the selected region (target_group) to it.
🔑 Ansible uses SSH to connect to the IPs in the chosen group.
📦 It installs Java, copies the JAR, and starts the app on each EC2 instance in that region.

✅ Interview-Ready Summary
"We use a parameterized Jenkins pipeline that triggers an Ansible playbook based on the selected region. The Ansible inventory is organized by region, 
and it uses SSH to deploy the JAR to the appropriate EC2s. This approach scales easily to multiple regions and environments, supports consistent deployments, 
and separates infrastructure logic from CI/CD logic."

2. if your Jenkins build failed with the resource constrains how can you debug that issue and how can you diagnose that?
✅ 2. Step 2: Check Jenkins Agent/Node Health
Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Nodes.
Select the node where the build ran and check:
Free disk space
Connected status
Executor usage
Load statistics
You can also SSH into the node and use:
top             # Check CPU & Memory usage
free -m         # RAM usage
df -h           # Disk usage
uptime          # Load average
vmstat 1 5      # Memory/CPU stats over 5 seconds

✅ 3. Step 3: Free Up Resources
Here are standard commands to clear up space:
# Remove Docker images and containers
docker system prune -af
# Clear workspace directories
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/*
# Clear Jenkins build history (if older builds not needed)
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/*/builds
# Clear logs
rm -rf /var/log/jenkins/*
# Temp files
rm -rf /tmp/*
Also make sure your Jenkins master has enough space if it's storing artifacts.

✅ 4. Step 4: Auto-Cleanup Strategy (Optional But Ideal)
Add post-build clean-up in your Jenkinsfile:
post {
    always {
        cleanWs()  // This cleans up the workspace after every build
    }
}

✅ 6. Step 6: Retry Build or Use Jenkins Retry Logic
Use a retry block in your pipeline:
retry(3) {
    sh 'mvn clean install'
}
If build fails because of temporary load, retrying helps.

✅ 7. Step 7: Prevention - Monitoring and Auto-Scaling
Set up:
CloudWatch Alarms (for EC2 agent disk, CPU)
Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
Slack/Email notifications for high usage
Auto-scaling group for Jenkins workers
Example in CloudWatch:
Alarm for disk < 10%
Alarm for memory > 90%
Alarm for swap usage

🎯 BONUS: What If Jenkins Is Hosted on Kubernetes?
Each agent pod should have CPU/Memory requests and limits.
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to add more pods during peak builds.
Use nodeSelector or taints to control where builds land.
Jenkins master should not be used for builds — only control plane.

✅ Final Interview-Ready Answer (Pro Level)
“When a Jenkins build fails due to resource constraints, I immediately check the build logs to identify if it's a CPU, memory, or disk issue. 
I inspect the Jenkins node metrics, either via the UI or by SSHing in and using Linux tools like top, df -h, and free -m. 
I clean up Docker artifacts, old build logs, and workspace data. If it's a frequent issue, I optimize our agents with proper memory/CPU requests, 
integrate alerts via CloudWatch or Prometheus, and scale Jenkins agents dynamically using auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes pods. 
I also use cleanWs() and retry blocks in pipelines to make them more resilient.”

3. If you application load balancer getting an error like 502 code how would you monitor and troubleshoot the issue?
✅ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide
1. 🔍 Check ALB Target Health
Go to EC2 > Load Balancers > Your ALB > Target Groups
Check target health status:
Is it healthy or unhealthy?
over the status to see why it's unhealthy.
🔧 Common issues:
Wrong port configured (e.g., your app runs on 8080 but ALB checks 80)
App not responding to health checks
App crashed or not started properly

2. 📜 Check ALB Access Logs
Enable access logs on the ALB
Look for 502 error codes
You’ll see which IP and path caused the issue

3. 🧪 Check Application Logs on Target EC2 / ECS / Lambda
SSH into the EC2 or check logs from CloudWatch or ECS logs:
Is the app running?
Does the app crash or throw errors?
Is the server (like Nginx/Tomcat) responding?

4. 🔧 Check Security Group and Network ACLs
Make sure:
ALB security group allows traffic to target EC2's port
EC2 security group allows traffic from ALB
No NACL is blocking the request

5. 🧠 Verify Listener & Target Group Configuration
ALB listener (say, HTTP:80 or HTTPS:443) forwards to correct Target Group
Target Group protocol and port match the app’s actual port

6. 🌐 Test the Application Manually
SSH into the EC2 and run:
curl http://localhost:8080

Or from another EC2 in same VPC:
curl http://<Target EC2 Private IP>:8080
✅ If this fails, your app is not running or has a config issue

7. 🔒 Check TLS/SSL (if HTTPS used)
If you're using HTTPS, make sure:
SSL cert is valid
App supports HTTPS if you terminate TLS at the instance level

🛠️ Final Checklist for Interview Answer:
“First, I check ALB target group health to confirm if targets are healthy. If they’re not, I SSH into the instance and check application logs and whether the app is responding 
on the correct port. I also verify that security groups, listener rules, and target ports are correctly set. 
If needed, I enable ALB access logs and CloudWatch metrics for deeper visibility. For HTTPS issues, I ensure SSL certs and protocols are configured properly.”

4. what is the difference between terraform and cloudformation why do we need to go with the terraform?
   “While CloudFormation is a native AWS service, we prefer Terraform because of its modular design, support for multiple cloud providers, 
   and the powerful plan feature that clearly shows the impact of changes. It also offers better reusability, faster iteration, and a larger community-driven ecosystem.”
   Tons of open-source modules, GitHub templates, and plugins — faster development & onboarding.

   “CloudFormation is great for AWS-native teams, but it has several limitations like verbosity, lack of multi-cloud support, limited modularity, 
    and slower adoption of new AWS features. Terraform gives us more flexibility, better code structure, and faster iteration with plan, apply, and reusable modules.”

5.what is stopping the instance and hibernating the instance?
  ✅ 1. Stopping an EC2 Instance
When you stop an EC2 instance:
The OS is shut down gracefully.
The instance store data is lost (if using ephemeral storage).
The EBS root volume is preserved.
The RAM content is cleared (i.e., memory state is not preserved).
No instance-hour charges apply while stopped (but EBS charges remain).
The public IP changes if it’s not an Elastic IP.
Instance can be restarted later — boots from scratch.

Interview explanation:
“When we stop an instance, the memory state is lost, and it boots as a fresh machine next time. It's ideal for temporarily deallocating resources without deleting them.”

✅ 2. Hibernating an EC2 Instance
When you hibernate an instance:
The OS is paused, not shut down.
The contents of RAM are saved to the EBS volume.
On restart, it resumes from the exact state it was paused in — apps, sessions, cache, etc. remain intact.
The EBS cost increases because it stores RAM snapshot.
Hibernation must be enabled when you launch the instance.
Only supported on:
Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows
Certain instance types (like t2, t3, m5)
Instances with less than 150 GB of RAM

Interview explanation:
“Hibernation is useful when we want to pause workloads and resume them quickly without restarting apps or reinitializing memory-heavy processes — for example,
long-running simulations or in-memory caches.”

6. Suppose I created an EC2 instance with the public IP so If i attach an EIP what will happen to the public IP?
   🔥 So, what happens to the original public IP?
👉 The auto-assigned public IP gets released immediately.
👉 Your instance now uses the Elastic IP (EIP) as its public IP address.

🧠 Why?
Because:
Auto-assigned public IPs are dynamic – they change on stop/start.
Elastic IPs are static – they stay with your account until you release them.
You can’t have two public IPs on the same network interface (by default).
Attaching an EIP replaces the auto-assigned public IP.

✅ Example for Interview:
“When an EC2 instance is launched with an auto-assigned public IP and later an Elastic IP is attached, 
 the original public IP is released immediately. The instance now communicates via the Elastic IP. 
 This is useful when we need a persistent public IP that doesn’t change across reboots or stops.”

7. "If everything seems correctly configured for your S3 bucket, but you're still unable to access it, 
    what could be the possible reasons and how would you troubleshoot?

1. Check Block Public Access Settings
Even if your bucket policy or object ACL allows public access, these settings override them.
Go to S3 → Bucket → Permissions → Block Public Access
Ensure block all public access is unchecked if you intend to allow public access.

2. Validate the Bucket Policy
Ensure the bucket policy is not too restrictive.
🔍 Example: To allow public read:
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  }]
}

3. IAM Role or User Policy Permissions
If you're using AWS CLI or SDK, make sure the IAM role/user has the right permissions.
✅ Minimum required for access:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}

4. S3 VPC Endpoint Restrictions
If your S3 access is through a VPC endpoint, check:
The endpoint policy might be denying access.
Bucket policy might allow access only from specific VPCs/VPC endpoint IDs.
📌 Bucket policy example restricting to VPC endpoint:
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-1234567890abcdef0"
  }
}

8. what is the difference between declarative and imperative pipeline??
   imperative uses groovy script and it started with node
   Declarative pipeline also built in groovy but it uses DSL
   Declarative starts with pipeline and groovy starts with node
   Declarative will be having Restart from stage and groovy doesn't have.

9. what is connection draining in load balancers and how to do that?
   Imagine you're deploying a new version of your application. If you terminate an instance immediately, 
   active users connected to that instance will lose their session or get errors.
   With Connection Draining:
   The instance stops receiving new requests.
   It continues to serve existing users until they complete or until a timeout is reached.
   Wait up to 300 seconds (5 minutes) for those users to finish.
   After that time, forcefully closes any remaining connections.

   🔧 How to Enable Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay) in AWS:
   ✅ For Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB):
   You configure this on the Target Group.

   🛠 Steps in Console:
   Go to EC2 Console > Target Groups.
   Select your target group.
   Click "Attributes" tab.
   Edit Deregistration Delay (Default: 300 seconds, i.e. 5 minutes).

   💡 Why this matters:
   Let’s say your app has:
   Long-running connections (e.g., file uploads, payments, video streaming)
   You terminate the instance without draining: users will get 502/504 errors.
   With Connection Draining, AWS waits to avoid cutting off active users.

   10. what are the plugins you installed in Kubernetes??
   Monitoring tools are deployed as pods in Kubernetes because everything in Kubernetes runs in containers. 
   Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are containerized and managed just like app workloads. 
   We install them as add-ons because Kubernetes by default is minimal—it provides orchestration but doesn’t include logging, 
   monitoring, or ingress capabilities, so we install the needed plugins depending on the use case

   ✅ 1. Install Calico (CNI Plugin)
Calico is used for network policies and pod networking.

📦 Apply Calico manifest (for kubeadm-based clusters):
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/calico.yaml

✅ 2. Install Prometheus & Grafana (Monitoring Tools)
You can install them using Helm (recommended way).

🛠 Step 1: Add the Helm repo
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

🧭 Step 2: Install Prometheus
 helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

 📊 Step 3: Install Grafana
  helm install grafana grafana/grafana --set adminPassword='admin123'

  You can access Grafana via:
   kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana"

  ✅ 3. Install NGINX Ingress Controller
  This is used to expose your apps to the outside world via HTTP/HTTPS.

📦 Apply NGINX ingress controller:
 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.9.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

10. How can you import the modules in Lambda function which are not available in AWS like pandas, numpy, matplotlib?
✅ Step-by-Step to Use Custom Libraries in Lambda
📦 Step 1: Set Up Your Working Directory
Create a project folder:
mkdir my_lambda_function
cd my_lambda_function

Create your Lambda function file (e.g., lambda_function.py):
import pandas as pd

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    data = {"Name": ["Anil", "John"], "Age": [28, 30]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df.to_json()

📥 Step 2: Install Dependencies Locally
Install the required libraries into a subfolder called python:

✅ Note: Use Amazon Linux 2 or a Docker image to ensure compatibility with the Lambda environment.
pip install pandas -t python/

🗜️ Step 3: Zip the Package
Move into the python directory and zip everything:
cd python
zip -r ../lambda_package.zip .

Add your Lambda function code to the zip:
cd ..
zip -g lambda_package.zip lambda_function.py

☁️ Step 4: Upload to AWS Lambda
You have two options:

Option A: Upload using AWS Console
Go to AWS Lambda → Your function → Upload zip file

11. how can you store the secrets in Kubernetes, suppose if you push secrets.yaml the secrets can be visible 
in repo and how can you encrypt them??

✅ Secure Solution 1: Bitnami Sealed Secrets
🔒 What is Sealed Secrets?
It’s a controller + CLI tool that encrypts secrets so you can safely store them in Git.
You create a secret as usual.
You encrypt it using the cluster's public key.
Only the cluster (with the private key) can decrypt it.
🔧 Setup Steps:
🔹 Step 1: Install Sealed Secrets in Your Cluster

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.24.1/controller.yaml

This installs the controller that will decrypt the secrets at runtime.

🔹 Step 2: Install the kubeseal CLI
On your local machine:
brew install kubeseal           # For Mac
sudo apt install kubeseal       # For Ubuntu/Debian

🔹 Step 3: Create a normal secret file (not apply yet)
   kubectl create secret generic my-secret \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password=123456 \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml > my-secret.yaml

This is a local file, not pushed to the cluster.
🔹 Step 4: Encrypt it using kubeseal
kubeseal --controller-name=sealed-secrets \
         --controller-namespace=kube-system \
         < my-secret.yaml \
         --format yaml > my-sealed-secret.yaml
This creates my-sealed-secret.yaml — it looks like this:
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  encryptedData:
    username: AgB3H9k...
    password: Ax98sK...

You can now safely push this to GitHub — it's fully encrypted.
kubectl apply -f my-sealed-secret.yaml
The controller will decrypt it inside the cluster and create a normal secret.

12. I have 3 azs and 3 nodes on each az suppose if I want to deploy a pod and each node in each az how can you do that??
 Step 1: Understand How Kubernetes Knows AZs
Cloud providers like AWS automatically label each node with the zone it's in:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep topology.kubernetes.io/zone
You’ll see:
ip-10-0-0-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1a
ip-10-0-1-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1b
ip-10-0-2-1   ...   topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1c

✅ Good News: You don't need to label manually in EKS — it’s automatic!

🥈 Step 2: Apply Deployment YAML with topologySpreadConstraints
Here’s the YAML to create a Deployment with 3 replicas, one in each AZ:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: 1
          topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
          whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: web-app
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
topologySpreadConstraints:- Spread rules for pod placement
maxSkew: 1:- No zone can have more than 1 extra pod compared to others
topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone: Spread based on AZs
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule: Don’t place pods if they violate spread

"To ensure high availability and zone-level redundancy, I used Kubernetes topologySpreadConstraints in my Deployment. 
This ensures the pods are evenly distributed across availability zones based on the node’s topology.kubernetes.io/zone label. 
I used maxSkew: 1 to enforce balance and DoNotSchedule to avoid overloading a zone. 
This gives automatic, clean, and production-grade zone balancing."

12. what are the difference between spot, on demand and dedicated instances??
✅ 1. On-Demand Instances
🔹 What it is:
You launch an EC2 instance when you need it and pay per hour or per second. There is no long-term commitment.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
You are building a web application for a client and you're testing different versions of it. 
You don’t know how long you'll need the server, maybe only a few days or weeks.
After 3 days, you complete the testing and terminate the instance. You only pay for those 3 days.

✅ 2. Reserved Instances (RIs)
🔹 What it is:
You commit to using an instance type in a specific region for 1 or 3 years in exchange for up to 75% discount 
compared to On-Demand.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
Your company has a production database server (t3.large) that must run 24/7 for 3 years.
You know it will be used continuously. So, you buy a Reserved Instance for t3.large in us-east-1.
This way, you save around 60-75% on the cost.

✅ 4. Dedicated Instances
🔹 What it is:
You get EC2 instances running on physical hardware that is fully dedicated to your AWS account.
Unlike normal EC2s which share hardware with other customers (multi-tenancy), this is single-tenant.

🔹 Real-Time Example:
You are working on a banking app that requires strict compliance and hardware isolation 
(for example, you must not share a physical server with another customer).

✅ What is a Spot Instance?
A Spot Instance is an EC2 virtual machine that uses unused EC2 capacity in AWS.
It’s very cheap — up to 90% less cost than On-Demand instances.
BUT… AWS can take it away anytime with a 2-minute warning ⚠️ if it needs that capacity back.

✅ Real-Life Example:
Let’s say your company is training a Machine Learning model that takes 4 hours.
This is a non-urgent task, and if it stops and resumes again later — it’s still fine.
So instead of using a normal On-Demand EC2 and spending ₹500, you launch a Spot Instance for the same type — and spend only ₹50
But remember:
If AWS needs that EC2 capacity, your instance is terminated suddenly.
So you must build your script to save progress every 15 minutes (like saving a game).

what is placement groups in AWS?
✅ Cluster
🔹Packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve 
  the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of
  high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
  You can launch multiple instance types into a cluster placement group.

✅ Partition 
🔹Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share 
  the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large 
  distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.
  A partition placement group supports a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone.
  The number of instances that you can launch in a partition placement group is limited only by your account limits.

✅ Spread 
🔹Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.
  A rack spread placement group supports a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone.
  For example, in a Region with three Availability Zones, you can run a total of 21 instances in the group, 
  with seven instances in each Availability Zone.

if I want to do some patching on RDS instance how can I do that??
✅ 1. Use Multi-AZ RDS Deployment
When you enable Multi-AZ:

AWS maintains a synchronous standby replica in another AZ.
During patching, AWS:
Patches the standby instance first.
Promotes it to primary.
Then patches the old primary.

🧠 Impact:
Small failover event (20–60 seconds), connections are automatically redirected.
No data loss or manual intervention required.

🔁 Maintenance Windows (If Above Aren’t Used)
If you're not using advanced setups:
Schedule patching during non-peak hours via Maintenance Window.
RDS will:
Take a snapshot
Apply patch
Reboot the instance (minor latency)

how can I build the RDS instance with the disaster recovery??

1️⃣ Enable Multi-AZ Deployment (High Availability)
📌 Why?
AWS automatically provisions a standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ).
In case the primary instance fails, it automatically fails over to standby.

2️⃣ Enable Automated Backups and Point-in-Time Recovery
📌 Why?
Allows you to restore your DB to any second within your backup window.
📌 Setup:
Configure retention period (up to 35 days).
Turn on automated backups.

3️⃣ Enable Cross-Region Read Replicas (for Regional Disaster Recovery)
📌 Why?
If your entire region goes down, a cross-region read replica can be promoted to become a standalone primary.
You can redirect traffic to the new region.

what are the difference between logs and metrics and traces??
📘 1. Logs – What Happened?
Think of logs like a diary of what your app/system is doing.
They are text entries generated by apps, services, OS, or middleware.
🔧 Example:
2025-04-14 12:01:32 ERROR: Database connection timeout for user_id=453

📊 2. Metrics – How Is It Performing?
Metrics are numerical values collected over time.
They are used in dashboards, alerts, autoscaling.
🔧 Example:
CPU Utilization: 85%
Request Latency: 140 ms
Disk IOPS: 400

🌐 3. Traces – What Path Did a Request Take?
Traces track the journey of a single request as it moves through different services in a distributed system.
Helps find bottlenecks in microservices.

🔧 Example:
A trace for API call /purchase:
→ frontend (50ms)
   → auth-service (30ms)
      → payment-service (120ms)
         → DB (10ms)

So, a trace helps you visualize:
Total request duration
Which service took the longest
Where failure or latency occurred

If there are multiple instructions are defined in Dockerfile which one is going to take execute??

FROM centos:centos7
CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install","httpd"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]

✅ 1. CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
This sets the default command to run only if no command is provided during container run
But CMD can be overridden by ENTRYPOINT
And here, it's never used — because ENTRYPOINT will run instead

⚠️ 2. ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install","httpd"]
This would have become the actual command executed when the container runs
But…

❌ 3. ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]
This overwrites the previous ENTRYPOINT
Docker only uses the last ENTRYPOINT defined — earlier ones are ignored
So this becomes the final and effective command that runs when the container starts

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello World"]

It will execute:
echo Hello World
✅ Because CMD acts as default arguments to ENTRYPOINT

CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"]

ENTRYPOINT is already providing its own full command with arguments: echo Hello World
So CMD is ignored entirely

FROM centos:centos7
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Anil is a DevOps pro"]

Output:
Anil is a DevOps pro

FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "First ENTRY"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Second ENTRY"]

🟢 Runs: echo Second ENTRY
🛑 First ENTRYPOINT is ignored

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint1.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]

❓ What Will Actually Execute?
/entrypoint.sh /entrypoint2.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint1.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint3.sh"]

✅ Final Effective Dockerfile (after resolution):
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint3.sh"]
CMD ["/entrypoint2.sh"]

🧠 Tip for Mastery:
Think of Docker like a "last-write-wins" config:
ENTRYPOINT → Main executable
CMD → Default argument(s) for ENTRYPOINT (only if no args passed during docker run)

See I have few aws accounts if any user tries to spin up an instances with specific instance type that should be denied
how can you do that?

✅ Solution: Use AWS IAM Policies to Deny Specific EC2 Instance Types
You can create an IAM policy that denies the RunInstances action if the instance type matches one or more specific types 
(e.g., t3.2xlarge, g4dn.xlarge, etc.)

🛡️ Example IAM Policy to Deny Specific Instance Types
 {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenySpecificEC2InstanceTypes",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": [
            "t3.2xlarge",
            "g4dn.xlarge",
            "r5.4xlarge"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

If the user tries to launch one of the restricted instance types, the request is denied.

💡 Pro Tip: Combine with Allow Policy
Make sure you don’t override with an explicit Allow policy elsewhere.
AWS always respects Deny first if both Allow and Deny are present.

Use AWS SCP (Service Control Policy) for Org-wide Enforcement
If you're using AWS Organizations, apply a Service Control Policy (SCP) at the OU (Organizational Unit) or account level to enforce 
restrictions across accounts.

🧠 Bonus: Condition by Tag or Region
You can even restrict by:
Region (aws:RequestedRegion)
AMI ID (ec2:ImageId)
Tags (to allow specific business units)

🔐 Use AWS Organizations + Service Control Policies (SCPs)
✅ What are SCPs?
Service Control Policies are like "guardrails" for all IAM entities (users/roles) in an account.
SCPs don't grant permissions — they set the maximum permissions.
Applied at the Organization Root, OU, or account level.

🛠️ Steps to Apply Least Privilege Policy Across All Accounts
🔹 Step 1: Enable AWS Organizations (if not already)
Sign in to your management/root account
Go to AWS Organizations
Create or manage an OU (Organizational Unit) with your AWS accounts

accounts

🔹 Step 2: Create an SCP with Least Privilege Rules
Example: Deny everything except S3 read-only and EC2 Describe actions
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowEC2Describe",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyAllOthers",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

📌 This effectively creates a least privilege boundary for every IAM user or role — 
    they cannot do anything outside of S3 read-only and EC2 describe.

🔹 Step 3: Attach SCP to Root or OU
Go to AWS Organizations > Policies > Service Control Policies
Create and attach the policy to:
The Root → affects all accounts
A specific OU → affects only grouped accounts

how the DNS resolution happen in AWS, suppose I have 100 instances and there is no load balancer so how the DNS resolution happen??
Option 1: Manually Use Private/Public IP or DNS
You connect directly using:
Private IP (if inside same VPC).
Public IP / Public DNS (if from internet).
But this is not scalable or fault-tolerant.

Option 2: Use Route 53 for Custom DNS Resolution
You create a Route 53 private hosted zone (if working within VPC).
You create a CNAME or an A record with multiple values (multi-value routing) to map to those 100 EC2 instances.
When a client queries DNS:
Route 53 returns a random subset of IPs (based on health check or round-robin).
The client connects directly to one of the IPs.
This is your manual DNS-based load balancing.

is AWS lambda can connect with VPC if yes then why??
But — like any compute — your Lambda still needs network access if it wants to:

Talk to a database
Hit an API
Reach an S3 bucket
Or call an external service
So let’s explore what kind of network Lambda runs in.

🌐 Where Does Lambda Run By Default?
By default, Lambda runs in an AWS-managed VPC.
This means:
You don’t see or control the network
Lambda is outside your own custom VPC
Lambda has internet access by default (via NATs AWS manages)
But it cannot access private resources inside your VPC

📌 What does "AWS-managed VPC" mean?
AWS creates and manages an internal, invisible VPC for running Lambda.
This is great for public internet calls — like hitting:
https://api.openai.com
https://yourapp.com/send-email

✅ But you cannot use it to:
Connect to a private RDS DB
SSH into a private EC2
Access internal-only APIs in your VPC
Because Lambda is outside your VPC, it has no route to those private subnets.

✅ Why Would You Connect Lambda to Your VPC?
If your Lambda function needs to access:
🗄️ RDS DB	You deployed it in private subnet, no public IP
🧠 ElastiCache / Redis	 Only accessible within the VPC
💼 EC2 backend	 EC2s are private, need Lambda to talk to them
🧪 Internal microservices (no internet endpoint)	Hosted in private subnets
🛡️ Private APIs or Internal NLBs Require internal DNS/IP access

🏗️ What Happens When You Attach Lambda to a VPC?
Lambda attaches ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) to the subnets you specify
These ENIs are how Lambda connects to your private network
Your Lambda runs inside the private subnet, just like EC2 would

🔒 But here’s the catch:
Now Lambda loses internet access!
Why? Because private subnets don’t have internet
So, if your Lambda also needs to call https://api.example.com, you must add:
A NAT Gateway
Or route to a public subnet

what are the post build actions??
📦 Archive Artifacts	
   Save build outputs (e.g., .jar, .zip, .war) to Jenkins
🔔 Send Notifications	
   Send emails, Slack, Teams, etc. based on success/failure
🔁 Trigger Downstream Jobs	
   Start other pipelines or jobs after current one finishes
📤 Deploy to Environment	
   Push artifacts to test/stage/prod environment
📄 Publish Test Reports	
   Show JUnit/TestNG/Surefire reports on the CI dashboard

what is the difference between identity and resources based policies in IAM??
1️⃣ Identity-Based Policy – Attached to a person/role
✅ Think of it like this:
"I am Anil, I should be allowed to create EC2 and upload files to S3."
This policy is attached to you (the IAM user or role).
🧑‍💻 Example:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}

➡️ Means: The identity this is attached to (like you or your EC2 role) can upload objects into my-bucket.
📦 Real-Life Example:
You have an EC2 instance in Account A.
You attach an IAM Role with identity-based policy allowing s3:GetObject.
Now the EC2 can read files from S3 (if permission is granted).

2️⃣ Resource-Based Policy – Attached to the resource
✅ Think of it like this:
"I am S3 bucket, I want to allow Anil from Account B to download my files."
This policy is attached directly to the AWS resource (like an S3 bucket, Lambda function, or SNS topic).
🪣 Example (S3 Bucket Policy):
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Anil"
  },
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}

➡️ Means: Anil from Account B can read files from my-bucket.

If user is not able to access to your application, how can you start troubleshooting and what steps you follow??
1️⃣ Check ALB DNS
Ask the user:
👉 “What URL or IP are you using?”
Run:
nslookup <your-ALB-DNS-name>
✅ Ensure it resolves to correct IPs.

2️⃣ Check Security Groups
ALB's security group must allow inbound on port 80/443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
EC2 instances must allow inbound from ALB security group on app port (e.g., 8080).

3️⃣ Check Target Group Health
Go to EC2 → Target Groups → Check Health Status
If targets are unhealthy:
❌ Wrong port in Target Group?
❌ App not running?
❌ Security Group blocks ALB?

4️⃣ Check App on EC2
SSH into the instance and verify:
ps -ef | grep <your-app>
curl http://localhost:<app-port>
✅ App must be running and responding locally.

5️⃣ Check Listener Rules
ALB Listener (HTTP/HTTPS) should forward to the correct target group.
Check for path-based routing rules if any.

6️⃣ Check NACLs & Route Tables
Ensure subnets where ALB and EC2 are deployed have:
Internet Gateway (for public access)
Proper Route Table
NACLs allowing traffic (stateless, so allow both inbound and outbound)

7️⃣ Check Logs
Enable ALB access logs in S3.
Check EC2 logs: /var/log/ or app-specific logs for errors.

what is application monitoring and infrastructure monitoring??
🔧 Infrastructure Monitoring – Detailed Explanation
Infrastructure monitoring is the process of continuously observing and tracking the health, performance, and availability 
of the core systems and hardware that support your applications.
Virtual machines (EC2, GCE, Azure VMs), Physical servers, Kubernetes nodes, Containers (Docker, Podman).

🔍 What does infrastructure monitoring capture?
Let’s say your application is hosted on AWS EC2 inside a Kubernetes cluster.
Infrastructure monitoring would track:
CPU usage: Are your nodes overutilized or underutilized?
Memory usage: Are any pods or servers about to run out of memory?
Disk space: Are your volumes or partitions nearly full?
Network bandwidth and latency: Is there any unusual traffic or network congestion?
Node health: Is a node in the cluster failing or disconnected?
Service availability: Are system services (like nginx, sshd, kubelet) up and running?

📲 Application Monitoring – Detailed Explanation
Application monitoring focuses on the internal behavior of your application code and how well it is serving users. 
Even if your servers are healthy, your application might be failing due to code bugs, slow database queries, 
or broken business logic.

🔍 What does it capture?
Let’s assume you’re running a microservices-based Java application for online banking.
Application monitoring tools would track:
API response times: How long does the /login or /transfer-money endpoint take?
Error rates: Are users seeing more HTTP 500 or 400 errors?
Exceptions and stack traces: Are any services crashing due to Java exceptions or Python errors?
Slow database queries: Are any SQL queries taking too long to execute?
User transactions: Can users complete critical flows like payments or registrations?

suppose I have dir and in that dir I have created few files if I want to delete some files between some time range how can i
do that??

find /home/anil/logs/ -type f -newermt "2024-12-01" ! -newermt "2025-01-01" -exec ls -l {} \;

Explain git branching strategy step by step??

Each new feature is developed in a feature/* branch created from dev.
Once tested, it’s merged into the dev branch and deployed to the dev environment.
Before production, we either:
   Directly merge dev into master (for simple projects), or
   Create a release/* branch for final UAT testing.
After UAT approval, the release branch is merged into master, which triggers production deployment via our CI/CD pipeline.
Any critical production issue is handled via hotfix/* branches created from master.

what is AWS parameter group and how do you use in your project??
   “In Amazon RDS, a parameter group acts like a configuration profile for the database engine. 
    It contains engine-specific parameters similar to what we configure manually in a traditional DBMS—for example,
    my.cnf in MySQL or postgresql.conf in PostgreSQL.

Each RDS instance is associated with a parameter group that defines how the engine behaves. 
Parameters can include things like:
max_connections
log_min_duration_statement
autovacuum
Memory/cache sizes

There are two types of parameters:
🔹 Dynamic – Changes apply immediately without restart.
🔹 Static – Changes need a DB instance reboot to take effect.

For example, in one of my projects, we had performance issues due to too many client connections. 
I created a custom parameter group and increased the max_connections value. 

✅ Scheduled a maintenance window: For production workloads, we scheduled the change during the maintenance window where a 
    reboot could happen with minimal business impact.

✅ Used Multi-AZ failover: If the instance was Multi-AZ, I applied the changes to the primary, triggered a manual failover,
   so AWS promoted the standby with the new parameters, minimizing downtime to under a minute.

How prometheus will scrape the metrics from kubernetes cluster??
🧠 Summary 
In our Kubernetes setup, we use Prometheus to scrape metrics from nodes, pods, and services. 
We deploy Prometheus using Helm (kube-prometheus-stack). Prometheus uses Kubernetes service discovery 
to automatically find pods or services exposing metrics, based on specific annotations like prometheus.io/scrape: "true". 
Every few seconds, Prometheus pulls the metrics from each discovered endpoint and stores them in its time-series DB. 
These metrics are then visualized in Grafana or used for alerting. This approach is dynamic and doesn’t require hardcoding 
IPs, which suits a dynamic orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

  How can you implement the jenkins pipeline to deploy the application into multicluster??
 “We have a CI/CD setup using a Jenkins multibranch pipeline. Our Git repo has three branches — dev, prod, and release — each
  representing a different environment. Jenkins is configured to detect these branches and run separate pipelines 
  based on the branch name. In the Jenkinsfile, we have conditional logic to use the correct Kubernetes cluster 
  by loading a secure Kubeconfig file stored in Jenkins Credentials. Once the branch is detected, 
  Jenkins checks out the code and deploys it to the respective cluster using kubectl or helm. We also have a GitHub webhook 
  that triggers the Jenkins pipeline automatically when a commit is pushed. This ensures that deployments happen 
  automatically and correctly for each environment without any manual intervention.”

what are the difference between ansible facts vs gather facts??
Think of it Like This:
🧠 Imagine you're a DevOps Engineer using Ansible to manage 100 servers.
Before you run any task on a server, wouldn’t you want to know things like:
What is the OS? How much RAM does it have? Which IP address is active? How many CPUs?

Ansible automatically collects this info at the beginning using a tool called the setup module.

✅ What are "Ansible Facts"?
🧾 Definition (In Simple Words):
Ansible Facts are just information (data) about your target servers (like hostname, IP, memory, OS, etc.) 
collected by Ansible before it runs tasks.
📦 Example of Some Facts:
ansible_hostname: webserver-1
ansible_os_family: RedHat
ansible_default_ipv4.address: 192.168.1.15
ansible_memory_mb.real.total: 8192

You can use these facts as variables in your playbooks.

✅ What is gather_facts?
💡 In Simple Words:
gather_facts is a yes/no switch at the beginning of your playbook.
If you set: gather_facts: true  ✅
Ansible will collect facts automatically using the setup module.
If you set: gather_facts: false ❌
Ansible will not collect any facts — unless you manually tell it to.

💡 Real-World Example – Let's Build a Simple Playbook
You want to install web servers:
If the system is RedHat: Install httpd
If the system is Ubuntu: Install apache2
Here’s the playbook:
- name: Install web server based on OS type
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true  # 💡 This collects the facts automatically

  tasks:
    - name: Install on RedHat
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"

    - name: Install on Ubuntu
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
🔁 What happens here:
You run the playbook.
Ansible first gathers facts (because gather_facts: true).
It learns what OS is running on each server.
Based on the OS, it decides which web server to install.

🤔 What If You Turn Off gather_facts?
gather_facts: false
Ansible won’t know anything about the target machine (no OS, no IP, no RAM). 
So using any fact like ansible_os_family will cause an error ❌

But you can still manually gather facts like this:
- name: Collect only networking facts
  setup:
    filter: ansible_default_ipv4

This gives you control and improves performance if you don’t need all the data.

🔥 Real Interview Tip (What You Can Say)
“Ansible facts are system information gathered by the setup module before executing tasks.
gather_facts is a flag in the playbook that decides whether Ansible should collect those factsautomatically. 
In large environments, we disable gather_facts for speed and manually collect only what we need, like IP addresses or memory stats.”

I have host file, lets consider almost 20 servers if I want to run my playbook on only one server how can I do that??

ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --limit server1
✅ --limit restricts the playbook execution to just server1.

ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --limit 192.168.1.10

Limit inside the playbook using hosts
- name: Run on single host
  hosts: server1   # or IP like 192.168.1.10
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Test reachability
      ping:

if I want to run particular task in ansible playbook how can I do that??

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: install

    - name: start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags: start

    - name: check nginx status
      shell: systemctl status nginx
      register: nginx_status
      tags: check

    - name: print nginx status
      debug:
        var: nginx_status.stdout
      tags: debug

ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --tags install
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --tags "install,start"

register: This captures and stores the command output into a variable called nginx_status.

🔍 Internally:
When this command runs, the result looks something like this (inside nginx_status):
nginx_status:
  stdout: |
    ● nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
       Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled)
       Active: active (running) since Tue 2025-05-27 10:15:27 UTC; 3h 20min ago
       ...
  stderr: ''
  rc: 0

✅ What it does:
debug: This is used to print/debug output in the terminal.
var: nginx_status.stdout tells Ansible to display only the standard output (stdout) of the nginx_status variable
     (i.e., the actual result of systemctl status nginx).

🧾 Sample Output in Console:
TASK [print nginx status] ****************************************
ok: [webserver1] => {
    "nginx_status.stdout": "● nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server\n   Loaded: loaded ... \n   Active: active (running) ..."
}

suppose I made some changes on ansible playbook and I ran and I need to see in the output that what exactly has changed
and what is the current one I need to see??

✅ By Default: Ansible Shows "Changed"
When you run a playbook, Ansible will output lines like:

TASK [Update Nginx config]
changed: [webserver1]

But this doesn't tell exactly what changed — just that something changed. To get deeper insight, let’s look at your options:

🔍 1. Use --diff Option
Run your playbook with:
ansible-playbook site.yml --diff
✅ What it does:
Shows a line-by-line diff for files or templates that changed.
Works well with modules like copy, template, lineinfile, etc.

🧠 2. Set check_mode and diff: true for Preview (Dry Run)
This will simulate the changes without applying them:
ansible-playbook site.yml --check --diff
Useful to:
See what would change
Validate before running in production

How can I check the syntax check in ansible??
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check

can you explain how can I run tasks parallelly and later how can I check whether the task is completed or not??
🔹 1. How to Run Tasks in Parallel in Ansible
Ansible runs tasks in parallel across multiple hosts by default using a feature called forks.

✅ A. Control Parallelism with forks
You can define the number of hosts to be handled in parallel by setting the forks value.

🔧 In your ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg):
 [defaults]
forks = 20

OR specify it when running the playbook:
ansible-playbook site.yml -f 20

🔸 This will run tasks on 20 hosts at the same time.

🔹 2. What About Running Tasks in Parallel on a Single Host?
You can use asynchronous tasks using async and poll.

✅ B. Example: Run Tasks in Background (Async)
- name: Run a long-running task in the background
  shell: /usr/bin/long_script.sh
  async: 300      # Maximum time the task is allowed to run (in seconds)
  poll: 0         # Don't wait for the task to finish
  register: background_task

his starts the task and moves to the next one immediately.
register stores the job ID.

🔹 3. How to Check If Background Task Completed
Use async_status to check its progress:
- name: Check status of the background task
  async_status:
    jid: "{{ background_task.ansible_job_id }}"
  register: job_result
  until: job_result.finished
  retries: 10
  delay: 5
This polls the job every 5 seconds, up to 10 times (50 seconds max).

✅ 1. async_status:
This is the Ansible module used to check the status of an asynchronous job.
It queries whether a previously launched async task has completed.

✅ 2. jid: "{{ background_task.ansible_job_id }}"
jid = Job ID.
When you run an asynchronous task (using async: 300, poll: 0), Ansible gives you a Job ID like 983462234.123.
That job ID is stored in the registered variable: background_task.ansible_job_id.

✅ 3. register: job_result
This tells Ansible to store the output of async_status in a variable called job_result.

This variable now holds details like:
job_result.finished → whether the job is completed.
job_result.rc → return code.
job_result.stdout → output of the background command.

✅ 4. until: job_result.finished
This is a loop condition.
Ansible will keep repeating this task until job_result.finished is true.

suppose if ansible playbook fails to run 20% of servers the ansible playbook should abort it, how can I do that??
✅ Solution: Use --forks + max_fail_percentage + serial
🛠 Ansible provides the max_fail_percentage setting for this:
🔧 Example Playbook Snippet:
- name: Example play
  hosts: all
  serial: 100%  # Run on all hosts in each batch
  max_fail_percentage: 20
  tasks:
    - name: Simulate task
      shell: "echo Hello from {{ inventory_hostname }}"

📌 What This Means:
serial: 100%: Run on all hosts at once (you can batch if needed).
max_fail_percentage: 20: If more than 20% of the hosts fail, Ansible aborts the playbook immediately.

what is ansible pull and why do we use this??
🔁 What is ansible-pull?
Normally, Ansible works in push mode, where you run ansible-playbook from a control node to connect and execute tasks on target nodes via SSH.

🔄 ansible-pull reverses this model.
It runs on the target node itself, pulls a playbook from a Git repo, and executes it locally.

📦 Use Case:
Imagine you have 100 EC2 instances and you don’t want to manage a central control node.
Instead, each instance runs a cron job or systemd timer that runs ansible-pull periodically.
The instance will pull the latest configuration from Git and apply it to itself.

ansible-pull -U https://github.com/anil-devops/infrastructure-config.git site.yml

write an ansible playbook which can create the user and assign to group??

---
- name: create user and assign to group
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    username: "anil"
    groupname: "devops"

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the group exists
      ansible.builtin.group:
        - name: "{{ username }}"
          state: present

    - name: create and assign user to group
      ansible.builtin.user:
        - name: "{{ username }}"
          group: "{{ groupname }}"
          state: present

if I want to delete the remote branch through git command line how can I do that??
git push origin --delete feature/test

what are the lambda layers?
Lambda Layers are a way to separate common code or dependencies from your Lambda function code and reuse them across 
multiple functions.

🔍 Why Do We Need Layers?
Imagine this:
You have 10 Lambda functions using the same Python package (e.g., requests, boto3, pandas).
Instead of packaging the same dependency again and again inside each Lambda zip, you can put it into a Layer.
This makes your Lambda packages lighter, modular, and easier to maintain.

📦 Real-Time Use Case
Imagine you're using Python in Lambda and you need:
requests for API calls
pandas for CSV processing

You create a Lambda Layer with these packages and attach the layer to all Lambda functions needing them.

what are the triggers in lambda function??
🔁 So What Are Triggers in Lambda?
Triggers are AWS services or events that automatically invoke a Lambda function.
Common triggers include:
API Gateway (for REST APIs), S3 (e.g., on file upload), DynamoDB Streams, CloudWatch Events / Schedules, SNS / SQS, 
EventBridge, Step Functions.

what is the difference between sudo su - and sudo - i commands?
The command **sudo su -** means:
"Use sudo to run the su - command."
The su command = "substitute user" or "switch user".

sudo su -
"Ask sudo to let me run the su - command (which then switches me to the root user)."
This relies on the su binary existing and being accessible.
❗ Problem:
If su is disabled or restricted (common in security-hardened systems), then:
sudo su - might fail.
Also, su may have its own authentication rules, making things more complex.

✅ Why sudo -i is better:
   This is a native capability of the sudo command.
   It does not call or depend on su.
   It directly runs a root shell, loading the root environment.

what is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture and what are the advantages and disadvantages??
🔷 1. Monolithic Architecture
📌 Definition:
A monolithic architecture is a single-tiered software application where all components (UI, business logic, database access, etc.) 
are tightly coupled and run as a single unit.

✅ Advantages:
Simple to develop: Easy to start and develop initially.
Easy to test: One application to test as a whole.
Straightforward deployment: Deploy once as a single unit.

❌ Disadvantages:
Difficult to scale: Scaling means scaling the whole app, even unused parts.
Hard to maintain: As the codebase grows, it becomes complex.
Tight coupling: A small change may affect the whole system.

🔷 2. Microservices Architecture
📌 Definition:
A microservices architecture breaks down the application into independent, loosely coupled services, where each service handles a 
specific business function and communicates via APIs (usually REST or messaging).
✅ Advantages:
Scalability: Scale individual services independently.
Faster deployments: Update/deploy individual services without affecting others.
Technology flexibility: Different services can use different languages or databases.
Fault isolation: If one service fails, others can continue working.
Better team autonomy: Teams can work independently on different services.

❌ Disadvantages:
Complexity: Managing many services is hard.
Distributed system challenges: Latency, monitoring, and data consistency issues.
DevOps overhead: Requires CI/CD, service discovery, containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
Testing is harder: Need integration testing across multiple services.
Network dependency: Inter-service communication can cause latency and failure points.

what is symlink and why do we use that??
A symbolic link is a file that contains a path to another file or directory. When you access the symlink, 
you're redirected to the actual target file or folder.
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink

what are the ways to deploy in Kubernetes cluster?
Imperative Commands, Declarative YAML Manifests, Helm Charts (Templated YAML), GitOps Tools (ArgoCD, Flux), 
Operators & Custom Controllers

how can you detect the anomaly detection in cloudwatch?
CloudWatch Anomaly Detection uses machine learning to automatically create a "normal" baseline for a metric and detect outliers 
(anomalies).
✅ How It Works
You pick a metric in CloudWatch (e.g., CPUUtilization)
CloudWatch applies ML models to historical data to understand normal behavior
It draws a confidence band (e.g., 95%) around the expected value
You create an alarm that triggers when the metric breaches the band

✅ Real-Time Use Case: Web Application on EC2
Scenario:
You have a web app running on EC2. Normally, CPU stays around 30-50% during the day but drops to 10-15% at night.
You want to get alerted if CPU suddenly spikes or drops unusually (even if still below 80%).

✅ Step-by-Step: Create Anomaly Detection in CloudWatch
CloudWatch → Metrics → EC2 → CPUUtilization
Click “Graphed metrics”
Check the box next to your metric
Click on the "⚙️ anomaly detection" icon (or right-click → "Add anomaly detection band")
Choose the confidence level (default: 95%)
🔹 This draws a shaded region (the band). If the metric leaves this band, it's considered an anomaly.

what are the encryption types are available if I want to do server side encryption in S3 bucket??
✅ 1. SSE-S3 (AES-256)
Encryption: AES-256
Key: Managed by S3
No need to do anything — just enable encryption on the bucket or object.
✅ Use Case: Simple encryption needs, minimal config
❌ No audit logs or control over keys

✅ 2. SSE-KMS (KMS Key - AWS or Customer Managed)
Encryption: AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
Key: Managed by AWS KMS (default or custom key)
You can use:
AWS-managed KMS key (default)
Customer-managed KMS key (CMK) (more control)
✅ Use Case:
Need audit logging (CloudTrail)
Per-object permissions using key policies
Key rotation enabled

✅ 3. SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)
Encryption: Your key (S3 uses it temporarily)
You must supply the key during both upload and download
AWS does not store your key

suppose I have 2 applications 1 is in one namespace and another one is in another namespace how can I ping from one to another??
✅ By Default: Yes, Cross-Namespace Communication Is Allowed
Kubernetes allows cross-namespace pod-to-pod communication by default as long as:
Network policies do not block traffic
DNS is used properly
✅ How to Ping (or cURL) Across Namespaces
You just need to use fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the service.

📌 Syntax:
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

I have 100GB EBS volume which is attached to EC2 instance now the size is 90% what can I do now and how can I increase the size??
In AWS, when an EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance is running out of space, I first increase the volume size via the AWS console
or CLI, which can be done live without detaching the volume. Then, inside the EC2 instance, I rescan the device so the OS recognizes
the new size, use pvresize to extend the LVM physical volume, followed by lvextend to expand the logical volume, and finally resize 
the filesystem with xfs_growfs or resize2fs depending on the filesystem type. This process allows seamless, 
non-disruptive storage expansion, ensuring applications continue running without downtime while gaining additional storage capacity.
